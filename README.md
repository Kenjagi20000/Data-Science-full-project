## 1. ABOUT THE PROJECT


This project will deal with Data scince analysis with python, SQL for DBMS, spread sheets,
Presention, Statistical inferences and modelling. I will also deal with graduation of 
mortality functions as well as survivolship. We will use a bunch of programmes and data set
from different area of studies that is form government statistics and demographic planning departments,
from school statistics, population and death data etc...


## Built with

For the succes of this project We will use different programming languages and softwares which includes but
not limited to:-
1. Python
2. SQL(Structured query language)
3. spreadsheets
4. modelling
5. latex
6. etc...

## 2. GETTING STARTED
Follow simple instructions as show while cording and get similar end product.
Make sure you have all the required environments setted up for python or for SQL.
For easy use you can download jupiter notebook to your desktop.


## Prerequisite

To get started with Jupiter notebook you can search jupiter notebook online and click the first link.
Down load it as required and as compatible to your desktop or laptop.

## Installtion

Below is an example of how you can install and setting up your app. 
This procedures doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.

Get a free API Key at https://jupiter.org/

Install JPNB packages as well and comprete your set up

You can run a simple calcualtion to confirm it is workin well as showm below:


 _import pandas as pd

 
 _pd.DataFrame((["Name" :"Evans"], ["Age" : 23]))


 ## 3. USAGE

I prefer you to use the documentation of their program. The document is found in their website.


## 4. ROADMAP
 Add  TO CATALOGUE:
1. import data set from different file formats eg: csv file, json, zipped files, excell file etc...
2. import the data as data frames using pandas
3. clean the data sets removing `NaN` values, removing incomsistent columns,
 filling `NaN` with a value say for example mean, drop unrequired columns,
 woking with formating data type and making them right etc...
4.  Visualization of our data set
5. Working with SQL
6. Working with Transactions in SQl (DBMS)
7. Machine learning techniques
8. modeling
9. Statistical inferences
10. graduation of inconsistent data values.
11. END of our project

## 5. CONTRIBUTING
Anyone can contribute to this project is it is based on an educational and practise point of view.
The project is done just to do allot of practise on my skills on my area of study
